<p><h3><font color="red"><h2>TITLE</h2></font>Hunting Unlimited and Ernest Lindleys' "A study of puzzles with Special Reference to the Pyschology of Mental Adaptation"</h3></p>

<p><font color="red"><h2>THESIS STATEMENT</h2></font> Lindley discusses how individuals play video games in order to expel energy, and make use of their survival skills. 
  I would like to apply this notion
to the video game Hunting Unlimited. Take a look at a clip from the game:</p>

<font color="red"><h2>MEDIA EXAMPLE</h2></font><video width="320" height="240" controls poster="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.e00dd71e585644f3511cdf49e32aaa6e?rik=znRZGfYQt0hAIQ&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">

</video>
<p><font color="red"><h2>COMMENT</h2></font>Listening to the theme song makes the player feel excited, and ready to play the game. While the image shows that the player is in a real world reality, something that they may
  experience for themselves. This game shows an everyday skill that was used in the beginning of time, but also is used now for people to get their food. Playing this game can help players
  to practice their hunting and survival skills as they might do in their real life, according to Lindley. </p><p>
Lindley describes such games as follows: <font color="red"><h2>"Play is a 'Vorubung und Einubung' of activities which soon are to be necessary to the serious
  life of the adult animal</h2></font>"the description of why we play video games  <font color="red"><h2>CITATION</h2></font><font color=green>(Lindley, "...Pyschology of Mental Adaptation" p. 3).</font>
