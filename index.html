<p><h3><font color="red"><h2>TITLE</h2></font>Hunting Unlimited and Ernest Lindleys' "A study of puzzles with Special Reference to the Pyschology of Mental Adaptation"</h3></p>

<p><font color="red"><h2>THESIS STATEMENT</h2></font> Lindley discusses how individuals play video games in order to expel energy, and make use of their survival skills. 
  I would like to apply this notion
to the video game Hunting Unlimited. Take a look at a clip from the game:</p>

<font color="red"><h2>MEDIA EXAMPLE</h2></font><video width="320" height="240" controls poster="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.e00dd71e585644f3511cdf49e32aaa6e?rik=znRZGfYQt0hAIQ&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">
<source src=""C:\Users\mcbra\Downloads\tomp3.cc - Hunting Unlimited 2010   Theme Song.mp3"" type="https://fanatical.imgix.net/product/original/5fa08783-b175-4317-bc47-5bb3845cc8ad.jpg?auto=compress">
</video>
<p><font color="red"><h2>COMMENT</h2></font>Listening to the theme song makes the player feel excited, and ready to play the game. While the image shows that the player is in a real world reality, something that they may
  experience for themselves. This game shows an everyday skill that was used in the beginning of time, but also is used now for people to get their food. Playing this game can help players
  to practice their hunting and survival skills as they might do in their real life, according to Lindley. </p><p>
Barthes describes such images as follows: <font color="red"><h2>QUOTE FROM THE READINGS</h2></font>"the singularity of the descriptive (or of the 'useless detail') in the
narrative fabric, its isolatedness, brings up a question of primary importance for the structural analysis of narrative" <font color="red"><h2>CITATION</h2></font><font color=green>(Barthes, "The Reality Effect" p. 12).</font>
